## Admin Role Access Restriction - Complete Fix Summary

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. Admin-to-Admin Access Restriction ?
Admin users were able to view other Admin users, which violated the business rule that Admins should only be able to access Client users.

#### 2. Self-Access for Admin Users ?  
The `/api/users/me` endpoint was incorrectly blocking Admin users from viewing their own profile due to role restrictions.

### Root Causes

#### Issue 1: Missing Role Validation
The `ValidateBankLevelViewAuthorizationAsync` method was not checking the target user's role for view operations. It only validated that users were in the same bank, but didn't restrict admins to only view Client users.

#### Issue 2: Self-Access Logic Order
The authorization service was checking scope-based rules before checking if the user was trying to access their own data, causing Admin users to be blocked from viewing themselves.

### Solutions Applied

1. **Added Role Validation for View Operations**
   - Modified `ValidateBankLevelViewAuthorizationAsync` to include role validation
   - Created separate validation methods for view vs modify operations with appropriate error messages

2. **Fixed Self-Access Priority**
   - Modified `ValidateViewUserAuthorizationAsync` to check self-access first before applying any role restrictions
   - Now ANY user can view their own profile regardless of role or scope

3. **Updated Error Messages**
   - View operations now show: "You can only access Client users."
   - Modify operations still show: "Only Client users can be modified."

### Before the Fixes

#### Issue 1: Missing Role Check
```csharp
private async Task<Result> ValidateBankLevelViewAuthorizationAsync(string targetUserId)
{
    var targetUserResult = await LoadTargetUserAsync(targetUserId);
    if (targetUserResult.IsFailure)
        return targetUserResult;

    // Missing role validation - allowed viewing any user in same bank!
    var bankAccessResult = BankGuard.ValidateSameBank(_currentUser.BankId, targetUserResult.Value!.BankId);
    return bankAccessResult;
}
```

#### Issue 2: Wrong Priority Order
```csharp
private async Task<Result> ValidateViewUserAuthorizationAsync(string targetUserId, AccessScope scope)
{
    return scope switch
    {
        AccessScope.Global => Result.Success(),
        AccessScope.Self => ValidateSelfViewAuthorization(targetUserId), // Only for Clients!
        AccessScope.BankLevel => await ValidateBankLevelViewAuthorizationAsync(targetUserId), // Blocks Admin self-access!
        _ => Result.Forbidden("Unknown access scope.")
    };
}
```

### After the Fixes

#### Complete Authorization Logic
```csharp
private async Task<Result> ValidateViewUserAuthorizationAsync(string targetUserId, AccessScope scope)
{
    // Check for self-access first - always allow users to view their own data regardless of role
    if (_currentUser.UserId.Equals(targetUserId, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
    {
        return Result.Success(); // ?? This fixes the /api/users/me issue!
    }

    return scope switch
    {
        AccessScope.Global => Result.Success(),
        AccessScope.Self => Result.Forbidden("Clients can only view their own data."),
        AccessScope.BankLevel => await ValidateBankLevelViewAuthorizationAsync(targetUserId),
        _ => Result.Forbidden("Unknown access scope.")
    };
}

private async Task<Result> ValidateBankLevelViewAuthorizationAsync(string targetUserId)
{
    var targetUserResult = await LoadTargetUserAsync(targetUserId);
    if (targetUserResult.IsFailure)
        return targetUserResult;

    // Now validates that target user is a Client ?
    var roleValidationResult = await ValidateTargetUserRoleForViewAsync(targetUserId);
    if (roleValidationResult.IsFailure)
        return roleValidationResult;

    var bankAccessResult = BankGuard.ValidateSameBank(_currentUser.BankId, targetUserResult.Value!.BankId);
    return bankAccessResult;
}
```

### Test Results

#### Issue 1: Admin-to-Admin Access
Now when an Admin tries to access another Admin user:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "errors": ["You can only access Client users."],
  "message": "You can only access Client users."
}
```

#### Issue 2: Self-Access (Fixed!)
Now when an Admin calls `/api/users/me`:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "19a16d6c-78dc-47de-8740-9c80f8cc1b90",
    "email": "alex.jones@example.com",
    "username": "alexjones",
    "role": "Admin",
    // ... their own profile data
  }
}
```

### Complete Authorization Matrix

| Acting User | Target User | Operation | Result | Reason |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Admin       | Self        | View      | ? Success | Self-access always allowed |
| Admin       | Self        | Modify    | ? Forbidden | Self-modification blocked |
| Admin       | Client      | View      | ? Success | Admin can view Clients |
| Admin       | Admin       | View      | ? Forbidden | Admin cannot view other Admins |
| Admin       | SuperAdmin  | View      | ? Forbidden | Admin cannot view SuperAdmins |
| Client      | Self        | View      | ? Success | Self-access always allowed |
| Client      | Other       | View      | ? Forbidden | Clients can only view themselves |
| SuperAdmin  | Any         | View      | ? Success | SuperAdmin has global access |

### Security Compliance ?

- **? Principle of Least Privilege**: Admins can only access what they need (Client users + themselves)
- **? Self-Access Rights**: All users can view their own profile regardless of role
- **? Role Separation**: Clear boundaries between Admin, Client, and SuperAdmin access  
- **? Bank Isolation**: Users can only access resources within their bank
- **? Appropriate Error Messages**: Context-specific error messages for view vs modify operations
- **? Consistent Authorization**: Same rules apply whether accessing via `/api/users/{id}` or `/api/users/me`

### Endpoints Now Working Correctly

1. **`GET /api/users/me`** ? - All users can view their own profile
2. **`GET /api/users/{id}`** ? - Role-based restrictions properly enforced  
3. **All other user operations** ? - Existing authorization preserved
