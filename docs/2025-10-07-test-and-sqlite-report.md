# Worklog: Integration & Withdraw Tests + SQLite run

Date: 2025-10-07

This document summarizes the work performed today to add unit and integration tests, make small provider-aware DbContext changes to run a relational SQLite in-memory test, and verify the test suites.

## High-level goal

- Validate DB-side filtering behavior (TransactionAuthorizationService) and exercise the Withdraw command handler with focused unit tests. Also attempt a relational verification on SQLite in-memory and make small, localized changes to support it.

## Summary of actions

1. Inspected relevant code and tests: `WithdrawCommandHandler`, `TransactionAuthorizationService`, and `ApplicationDbContext`.

2. Added unit tests for Withdraw handler:

   - `tests/BankingSystemAPI.UnitTests/UnitTests/Application/Features/Transactions/Commands/WithdrawCommandHandlerTests.cs`

     - Tests: happy path, invalid amount, authorization denied, inactive account, concurrency conflict (retry).

3. Extended InMemory integration tests for TransactionAuthorizationService with bank-level and pagination checks.

4. Implemented small provider-aware changes in `ApplicationDbContext` so a SQLite in-memory relational test could run:

   - Skip SQL Server sequence creation when the provider is SQLite.
   - Convert `GETUTCDATE()` default SQL to `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` for SQLite.
   - For SQLite, mark `RowVersion` properties as `ValueGenerated.Never` so tests can supply the value.

5. Added a SQLite relational integration test:

   - `tests/BankingSystemAPI.IntegrationTests/TransactionAuthorizationServiceSqliteTests.cs` — seeds identity data, bank, currency, account, transaction, and validates the service filter behavior against SQLite.

6. Ran tests locally and iteratively fixed seed/order and provider issues until green.

## Test commands & results

Unit tests:

```powershell
dotnet test tests/BankingSystemAPI.UnitTests/BankingSystemAPI.UnitTests.csproj -c Release --logger:trx
```

- Result: All unit tests passed (177 total).

Integration tests (InMemory + SQLite):

```powershell
dotnet test tests/BankingSystemAPI.IntegrationTests/BankingSystemAPI.IntegrationTests.csproj -c Release --logger:trx
```

- Result: All integration tests passed (4 total), including the new SQLite relational test.

## Files added or modified

- Added:
  - `tests/BankingSystemAPI.UnitTests/.../WithdrawCommandHandlerTests.cs` — unit tests for Withdraw handler.
  - `tests/BankingSystemAPI.IntegrationTests/TransactionAuthorizationServiceSqliteTests.cs` — SQLite relational test.

- Modified:
  - `src/BankingSystemAPI.Infrastructure/Context/ApplicationDbContext.cs` — provider-aware adjustments in `OnModelCreating`.
  - `tests/BankingSystemAPI.IntegrationTests/TransactionAuthorizationServiceTests.cs` — added InMemory bank-level and pagination tests.

## Why these changes

- The codebase originally assumed SQL Server semantics (sequences, `GETUTCDATE()`, rowversion). Running a relational SQLite test required small compatibility adjustments to the EF model for test-time only.

## Caveats

- The provider checks in `OnModelCreating` are minimal but runtime-specific. If you prefer no runtime branching, we can introduce a test-only flag or an injectable option to control SQLite compatibility.

## Next steps (recommendations)

- Decide whether to keep provider-specific model adjustments or gate them behind a test-only configuration.
- Add further integration tests for more transaction scenarios if desired.
- I can open a PR with these changes and include the test run outputs if you want.

If you want this converted into a short PR description or a commit message, say the word and I'll produce it.

## DbCapabilities & related types

- Types:
  - `BankingSystemAPI.Application.Interfaces.Infrastructure.IDbCapabilities` — an interface which exposes `bool SupportsEfCoreAsync { get; }`.
  - `BankingSystemAPI.Application.Interfaces.Infrastructure.DbCapabilitiesOptions` — configuration POCO with `bool? SupportsEfCoreAsync` used to override capability detection.
  - `BankingSystemAPI.Infrastructure.Setting.DbCapabilities` — runtime implementation; it reads the optional `DbCapabilitiesOptions` and falls back to service-based detection (checks for `ApplicationDbContext`/`DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext>` registrations) to decide whether EF Core async support should be considered available.

- Registration & usage:
  - Registered in `Program.cs` (presentation project):
    - `builder.Services.Configure<DbCapabilitiesOptions>(configuration.GetSection("DbCapabilities"));`
    - `builder.Services.AddSingleton<IDbCapabilities, DbCapabilities>();`
  - Consumed by `TransactionAuthorizationService` to decide whether to use EF/Core-style async patterns or fall back to safe synchronous/in-memory alternatives (`var isEfCore = _dbCapabilities?.SupportsEfCoreAsync ?? false;`).

- Tests:
  - Unit and integration tests frequently mock or provide a fake `IDbCapabilities` (e.g., `dbCapMock.Setup(x => x.SupportsEfCoreAsync).Returns(true/false)`) so tests can force the service down the EF-core-path or the fallback path during verification.
  - The SQLite relational test seeds a mocked `IDbCapabilities` as part of test setup when needed.

This section documents why `DbCapabilities` exists and how it was used while adding the TransactionAuthorizationService tests and the SQLite run.

### Program.cs registration (exact lines)

The code registers the DbCapabilities options and implementation in `Program.cs` as follows:

```csharp
// Register DB capabilities and TransactionAuthorizationService
builder.Services.Configure<BankingSystemAPI.Application.Interfaces.Infrastructure.DbCapabilitiesOptions>(builder.Configuration.GetSection("DbCapabilities"));
builder.Services.AddSingleton<BankingSystemAPI.Application.Interfaces.Infrastructure.IDbCapabilities, BankingSystemAPI.Infrastructure.Setting.DbCapabilities>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<ITransactionAuthorizationService, TransactionAuthorizationService>();
```
